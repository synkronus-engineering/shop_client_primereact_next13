# Course Code for Online Shop Client With NextJS 13+

<br/>
This GitHub repo includes the final code for all the modules in the course

## Course Description

In this course we will focus on the framework showcase with the creation of an online store that includes all the necessary features for online sales & management, such as:

- Landing page,
- Products search and detail
- Shopping cart
- Payment gateway
- User portal where you can manage
  - Orders status
  - Profile information
  - Support tickets
  - Favorites list

And much more!

When you are finished with the course, youâ€™ll have the skills and knowledge necessary to build real world React applications that manage typical data scenarios found in both small home grown web site projects, as well as full enterprise applications.

##### What to expect from this course?

For the development of this course I will emphasize the step by step required for the construction of the Online Shop, the business logic and I will assume that you took the fundamentals course [Building Full stack application with NextJs 13+](https://www.udemy.com/course/fullstack-nextjs-13-recoil-supabase) where I explain in detail the concepts and tools required for the development of this project.
You will have access to two repositories, one containing the base code of the course and the other with scripts to configure to the persistence system, mock data and the migration scripts to configure to the production environment.
The first module contains the summary of the strategies implemented in the NextJs fundamentals course, with which we managed to organize the code base, configure the persistence system, configure the authentication and authorization mechanism, organize the continuous integration and deployment system and database migrations, with this in place we're ready to start with the construction of the online store, if you have any doubts that may arise from the first module, please go to the fundamentals course where each of these items are discussed in detail.

I hope this work will help you to deepen the management of the NextJs framework and offer a quality product within your portfolio of solutions.
